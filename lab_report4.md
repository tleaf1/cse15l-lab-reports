# Lab Report 4

## Competition Task Walkthrough

**Step 1: Logging in to ieng6**

Keys pressed: `Ctrl-R`, typed 'ssh', `Space`, `Enter` which successfully logged me in. The command `ssh cs15lwi23apz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` was already in the bash search history so I was able to directly access it with the Ctrl-R command.

**Step 2: Cloning the Repository for the Task**
  
Keys pressed: `Ctrl` + R, typed 'git', `space`, typed 'c', `enter`. Since the `git clone git@github.com:tleaf1/lab7.git` command was already in the search history I was able to directly access it as well and use the command without repeatedly using the up arrow command or typing the full command out.

**Step 3: Initial Run of JUnit Tests**

Keys pressed: Typed 'cd lab7', `Ctrl` + R, then I typed 'javac' and then `enter`, then `Ctrl` + R, then I typed 'java' then `space` and then `enter`. Similar to the last two commands, the commands to run JUnit were already in the bash history so I was able to quickly run them again by using the Ctrl-R command without having to go and copy paste the two commands or remember how to type them all out.

**Step 4: Editing the Java File to Fix the Error**
  
Keys pressed: I typed 'nano +43 Li' `<tab>` then typed '.java', `<enter>`, `<right>` x12, `<backspace>`, typed 2, `<Ctrl-O>`,`<enter>`, `<Ctrl-X>`.

**Step 5: Rerunning the Tests**

Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><up><enter>`,`<up><up><up><up><enter>`. Since these commands were recently ran, I used the up arrow to quickley access them instead of using the 'Ctrl-R' command that was previously used.

**Step 6: Committing and Pushing to GitHub!**

Keys pressed: `<Ctrl-R>`, then I typed 'git a', `<enter>`; `<Ctrl-R>`, then I typed 'git co', `<enter>`; `<Ctrl-R>`, then I typed 'git p', `<enter>`. Since these three commands ('git add ListExamples.java', 'git commit -m "updated"', and 'git push', respectively) were already in the bash command history I used the 'Ctrl-R' command again to make their execution much quicker.
