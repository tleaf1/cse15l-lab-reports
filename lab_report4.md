## Competition Task Walkthrough

**Step 1: Logging in to ieng6**

Keys pressed: <Ctrl> + R, then I typed ssh and then <enter> which successfully logged me in. The command `ssh cs15lwi23apz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` was already in the bash search history so I was able to directly find it with the Ctrl-R command.
  
**Step 2: Cloning the repository for the task**
  
Keys pressed: <Ctrl> + R, then I typed git c and then <enter>. Since the `git clone`command was already in the search history I was able to directly access and use the command without repeatedly using the up arrow command or typing the full command out.
